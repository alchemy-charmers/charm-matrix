  Synapse is a reference "homeserver" implementation of Matrix, from the core development team at
  matrix.org. It is written in Python/Twisted and is intended to showcase the concept of Matrix.

  In Matrix, every user runs one or more Matrix clients, which connect through to a Matrix homeserver.
  The homeserver stores all their personal chat history and user account information -
  much as a mail client connects through to an IMAP/SMTP server.

  Just like email, you can either run your own Matrix homeserver and control and own your own
  communications and history or use one hosted by someone else (e.g. matrix.org) -
  there is no single point of control or mandatory service provider in Matrix,
  unlike WhatsApp, Facebook, Hangouts, etc.

  This charm additionally installs the tools to federate your home server with Discord, Slack and IRC.
