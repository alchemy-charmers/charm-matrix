summary: Matrix decentalised communication Synapse home server

  Synapse is a reference "homeserver" implementation of Matrix, from the core
  development team at matrix.org. It is written in Python/Twisted and is
  intended to showcase the concept of Matrix.

  In Matrix, every user runs one or more Matrix clients, which connect through
  to a Matrix homeserver. The homeserver stores all their personal chat history
  and user account information - much as a mail client connects through to an
  IMAP/SMTP server.

  Just like email, you can either run your own Matrix homeserver and control
  and own your own communications and history or use one hosted by someone
  else (e.g. matrix.org) - there is no single point of control or mandatory
  service provider in Matrix, unlike WhatsApp, Facebook, Hangouts, etc.

  This charm is designed to be used in conjunction with Matterbridge in order
  to integrate with 3rd party chat systems, such as Mattermost, IRC, Slack, etc.
